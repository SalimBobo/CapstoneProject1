    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p>
      Currently, I am a freshman at one of the best IT universities in
      Uzbekistan which is named PDP (Personal Development Process). Currently, I
      am learning C++ and Web Development courses. After learning fundamental
      skills from C++, I am going to start a Java Backend course. And also I
      have started Full Stack web development course on Udemy. According to my
      plan, and if God wants, I will be a junior Full Stack web developer with
      Java Backend in January 2024, Inshallah!!!
